# Fini

Fini is a small state machine library built on top of the brilliant [use-effect-reducer](https://github.com/davidkpiano/useEffectReducer/).

# Motivation

Fini aims to be a simpler alternative to fully-fledged statechart libraries, such as [XState](). It aims to capture the features I find myself using most of the time, with type-safety and simplicity in mind.

You might like Fini if you

- want something slightly more structured than a reducer
- enjoy typing ðŸ˜‰
- want to get into basic state machines

# Installing

```bash
npm install fini
```
