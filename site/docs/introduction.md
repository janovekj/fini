Using finite state machines (FSM) is a great way to safely and effectively create complex UI components. Fini aims to lower the bar of getting started with this powerful concept, all while providing the important features you should expect from an FSM library:

- ‚úÖ easy-to-use hook for defining states, transitions and effects
- ‚úÖ type safety all the way
- ‚úÖ simple state-matching and event-dispatching from your components

Furthermore, you might like Fini if you

- want something slightly more structured than the regular reducer
- enjoy typing üòâ
- want to get into the basics of state machines

If this all sounds good to you, go right ahead and jump into the [quick-ish start](./quick-start) to hit the ground running.

If you want to get a slightly deeper understanding of how Fini works, give the [Essentials section](essentials/core-concepts) a quick read.

Love reading? Then the [step-by-step tutorial](step-by-step/creating-a-login-machine) was made for you!
