Hopefully you've gotten a good grasp on how Fini works. If not, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/janovekj/fini/issues) if you see something that could be explained better. Fini is meant to an accessible tool for everyone, and that all begins with good docs.

If the concept of state machines is still a bit unclear, you could also check out some of the [resources](../other-resources.md), which probably offer way better explanations.
