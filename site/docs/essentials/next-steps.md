Hopefully you've gotten a good grasp on how Fini works. If not, try reading the [step-by-step tutorial](/step-by-step/creating-a-login-machine), which gives you the different parts of Fini in bite-sized chunks. Also feel free to create an issue if you see something that could be explained better. Fini is meant to an accessible tool for everyone, and that all begins with good docs.
