Fini sticks to the core concepts that are associated with most finite state machines:

- finite states (duh!)
- transitions between states
- extended state (context)
- side-effects

If you're new to state machines, don't worry! This documentation assumes some knowledge, but give the [Statecharts projects introduction](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html) a quick read, and you'll be up to speed in no time!

The next sections show Fini's approach to these concepts, as well as how it all works together with React and TypeScript.
